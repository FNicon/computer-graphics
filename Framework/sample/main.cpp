    If you don't know how to use our computer graphics framework,
    please open header files (.h) in lib folder for documentation.

    To create new project in computer-graphics repository, open Terminal, and use [./create folder_name] command.
    To generate new Makefile, open Terminal in project root, and use [./makegen] command.
    To compile source files into executable, open Terminal in project root, and use [make] command.
    To remove all object files and executables, open Terminal in project root, and use [make clean] command.
    To run executable, open Terminal in project root, and use [./run] command.
    To run executable in debugging mode, open Terminal in project root, and use [./run --debug] command.

    Notes:
    - Do not use spaces in any file name or folder name. Violation to this rule will cause compilation failure.
    - If you want to change any framework code, please edit the code inside Framework/lib folder. Other lib folders just a symlink to this folder.
    - Always use available commands above.

    Have fun!
    And don't forget the 5 stages of debugging! :)

    Hang on a minute.
    I want to give special thanks for the following contributors.

    nieltg, for helping me writing makegen, understanding Linux and writing unreadable code.
    FNicon, for writing code to cover all corner cases in Bresenham's line algorithm
    handikao29, for creating lots of fonts by lots of brute force
    Vigasto and emiliarazak, for being members of our team. No offense guys :)

    That's it.
    I think that's enough from me.
